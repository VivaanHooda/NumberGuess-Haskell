# NumberGuess-Haskell

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game in Haskell!

## Overview

This project allows users to play a simple number guessing game where they try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower than the target number and keeps track of the number of attempts made by the user.

## How to Play

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/specdrake28/NumberGuess-Haskell.git
   ```

2. Build the Haskell Program:
   ```bash
   ghc Guess.hs
   ```

3. Run the Game:
   ```bash
   ./Guess
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number within the specified range.

## Gameplay

- The game will start by providing instructions and generating a random number between 1 and 16.
- You will be prompted to enter your guess.
- Based on your guess, the program will provide feedback, informing you if your guess is too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
- The program will display the number of attempts it took you to guess the correct number.

## Example Code

```haskell
import System.Random 

loop n tries = do
    putStrLn "please guess the number"
    l <- getLine
    let i = read l :: Int
    if i == n
    then putStrLn $ "You GUESSED it in " ++ show tries ++ " tries. Congratulations!!!!"
    else if i > n
         then do
             putStrLn "Too High"
             loop n (tries+1)
         else do
             putStrLn "Too Low"
             loop n (tries+1)

main = do
    putStrLn "In this game, you will have to guess a number generated by the computer between 1 and 16. Let's START!!!"
    g <- randomRIO (1,16)
    loop g 1
```
